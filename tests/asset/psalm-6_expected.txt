<b>Psalm 6<i>[a]</i></b>

<b>For the director of music. With stringed instruments. According to <i>sheminith.</i><i>[b]</i> A psalm of David.</b>

 <b>¹</b> LORD, do not rebuke me in your anger
    or discipline me in your wrath.
 <b>²</b> Have mercy on me, LORD, for I am faint;
    heal me, LORD, for my bones are in agony.
 <b>³</b> My soul is in deep anguish.
    How long, LORD, how long?

 <b>⁴</b> Turn, LORD, and deliver me;
    save me because of your unfailing love.
 <b>⁵</b> Among the dead no one proclaims your name.
    Who praises you from the grave?

 <b>⁶</b> I am worn out from my groaning.

All night long I flood my bed with weeping
    and drench my couch with tears.
 <b>⁷</b> My eyes grow weak with sorrow;
    they fail because of all my foes.

 <b>⁸</b> Away from me, all you who do evil,
    for the LORD has heard my weeping.
 <b>⁹</b> The LORD has heard my cry for mercy;
    the LORD accepts my prayer.
 <b>¹⁰</b> All my enemies will be overwhelmed with shame and anguish;
    they will turn back and suddenly be put to shame.
