<b>Qualifications for Overseers and Deacons</b>

Here is a trustworthy saying: Whoever aspires to be an overseer desires a noble task. <b>²</b> Now the overseer is to be above reproach, faithful to his wife, temperate, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, <b>³</b> not given to drunkenness, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money. <b>⁴</b> He must manage his own family well and see that his children obey him, and he must do so in a manner worthy of full<i>[a]</i> respect. <b>⁵</b> (If anyone does not know how to manage his own family, how can he take care of God’s church?) <b>⁶</b> He must not be a recent convert, or he may become conceited and fall under the same judgment as the devil. <b>⁷</b> He must also have a good reputation with outsiders, so that he will not fall into disgrace and into the devil’s trap.

 <b>⁸</b> In the same way, deacons<i>[b]</i> are to be worthy of respect, sincere, not indulging in much wine, and not pursuing dishonest gain. <b>⁹</b> They must keep hold of the deep truths of the faith with a clear conscience. <b>¹⁰</b> They must first be tested; and then if there is nothing against them, let them serve as deacons.

 <b>¹¹</b> In the same way, the women<i>[c]</i> are to be worthy of respect, not malicious talkers but temperate and trustworthy in everything.

 <b>¹²</b> A deacon must be faithful to his wife and must manage his children and his household well. <b>¹³</b> Those who have served well gain an excellent standing and great assurance in their faith in Christ Jesus.

<b>Reasons for Paul’s Instructions</b>

 <b>¹⁴</b> Although I hope to come to you soon, I am writing you these instructions so that, <b>¹⁵</b> if I am delayed, you will know how people ought to conduct themselves in God’s household, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and foundation of the truth. <b>¹⁶</b> Beyond all question, the mystery from which true godliness springs is great:

He appeared in the flesh,
    was vindicated by the Spirit,<i>[d]</i>
was seen by angels,
    was preached among the nations,
was believed on in the world,
    was taken up in glory.
