The word of the LORD that came to Micah of Moresheth during the reigns of Jotham, Ahaz and Hezekiah, kings of Judah—the vision he saw concerning Samaria and Jerusalem.

 <b>²</b> Hear, you peoples, all of you,
    listen, earth and all who live in it,
that the Sovereign LORD may bear witness against you,
    the Lord from his holy temple.

<b>Judgment Against Samaria and Jerusalem</b>

 <b>³</b> Look! The LORD is coming from his dwelling place;
    he comes down and treads on the heights of the earth.
