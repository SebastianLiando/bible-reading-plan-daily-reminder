<b>BOOK I</b>

<b>Psalms 1–41</b>

<b>Psalm 1</b>

 <b>¹</b> Blessed is the one
    who does not walk in step with the wicked
or stand in the way that sinners take
    or sit in the company of mockers,
 <b>²</b> but whose delight is in the law of the LORD,
    and who meditates on his law day and night.
 <b>³</b> That person is like a tree planted by streams of water,
    which yields its fruit in season
and whose leaf does not wither—
    whatever they do prospers.

 <b>⁴</b> Not so the wicked!
    They are like chaff
    that the wind blows away.
 <b>⁵</b> Therefore the wicked will not stand in the judgment,
    nor sinners in the assembly of the righteous.

 <b>⁶</b> For the LORD watches over the way of the righteous,
    but the way of the wicked leads to destruction.
